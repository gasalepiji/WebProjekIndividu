                <p id="copyBlocker">Airy and Alfie walked unsteadily through the ruins of the city, trying to escape the traces of the Thanamos Cult. Gunfire and explosions echoed in the distance, signs of an unending world war. Their bodies were still weak from torture, especially Airy, whose strength had been completely drained. <br><br>As they stepped into a deserted street, a German military patrol passed by. The soldiers stopped, aiming their weapons at the pair. <br><br>“Halt! Who are you?!” shouted one of the soldiers in a firm accent. <br><br>“We’re not enemies... please...” Alfie replied weakly, raising his hands to show they were unarmed. <br><br>Seeing their pitiful condition, the German soldiers decided to take them to the military headquarters in Berlin. There, they were given a place to rest, warm food, and basic medical care. <br><br>Airy lay on a simple bed, still looking pale. Alfie sat beside her, gripping her hand tightly. <br><br>“You have to hold on, Airy,” Alfie whispered softly. “We’ll get through this together.” <br><br>But the situation in Berlin was far from safe. Attacks from American and Russian forces continued to hammer the city, adding to the panic among German civilians and military personnel. Every second was a matter of life and death. <br><br>When Alfie felt strong enough to help, he tried using his healing powers to speed up Airy’s recovery. But as he attempted to activate his energy, something unusual happened. The power vanished as if absorbed by something invisible. <br><br>“Our powers... don’t work here,” Alfie murmured anxiously. <br><br>A German scientist, overhearing his complaint, explained, “Here in Berlin, there are three magical stones discovered from ancient ruins. These stones can neutralize cosmic or supernatural energy. We use them to counter Russian biochemical weapons, but it seems they’re also affecting you.” <br><br>Alfie clenched his fists. “We need to get rid of those stones.” <br><br>But Airy, still weak, spoke in a hoarse voice, “Don’t be reckless, Alfie... focus on what we can do for now.” <br><br>Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Ei, Allen, and Firefly were under the control of the Thanamos Cult. They had been brainwashed, and their cosmic powers were absorbed into the magical stones, which now made the cult even stronger. With that power, Ei, Allen, and Firefly were turned into terrifying living weapons. <br><br>In Berlin, tensions reached their peak when German intelligence reported that Russia had prepared a nuclear bomb aimed at the city. The brutal assault that had haunted them culminated in this moment. <br><br>When the bomb finally dropped, a massive explosion shook Berlin, obliterating most of the city. Radiation spread quickly, consuming everything in its path. Alfie, who was near the blast zone, felt something strange. His body began to heat up and then emitted a blinding green light. <br><br>As the dust settled, Alfie stood, now radiating nuclear energy. The radiation hadn’t killed him; instead, it gave him new strength. His body was fully healed, and he felt more powerful than ever. <br><br>“I... I can heal her,” Alfie said, rushing back to where Airy lay. <br><br>He placed his hands on Airy’s body and began channeling his newfound healing power. The process was slow, as Airy was the strongest cosmic being ever to exist, but Alfie persisted. <br><br>As the healing process continued, a massive earthquake shook Berlin. In the distance, a horrifying sight appeared. Ei, Allen, and Firefly, now under the control of the Thanamos Cult, launched a large-scale attack on the city. They destroyed everything in their path, sending waves of destruction that tore through buildings and claimed thousands of lives. <br><br>“No... this can’t be,” Alfie murmured as he watched his friends turned into instruments of devastation. <br><br>Their attack caused the ground to crack and buildings to collapse, making it even harder for Alfie to heal Airy. But he refused to give up. With unwavering determination, he continued the healing process despite the tremors. <br><br>“I won’t leave you, Airy,” Alfie said firmly. “I’ll save you, and we’ll save them.” <br><br> Airy, though still weak, heard Alfie’s words. In her heart, she knew they had to survive. They not only had to save themselves but also bring their friends back to the right path.</p><br>
