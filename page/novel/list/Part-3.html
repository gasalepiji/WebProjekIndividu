                <p id="copyBlocker">A massive explosion from Ei, Allen, and Firefly's attack shook the Berlin base. Amid the chaos, Alfie remained focused on healing Airy. His hands glowed green with nuclear energy, radiating waves of healing energy into Airy's body. However, the process was agonizingly slow. Only about 1 percent of Airy's strength had been restored, but it was enough to reignite her cosmic potential. <br><br>Suddenly, Airy's body emitted a bright light so intense that it enveloped the entire city of Berlin. Her cosmic energy erupted like a storm of auroras, spreading across every corner.  <br><br>“Airy!” Alfie shouted as the light engulfed him.  <br><br>When the light subsided, Airy rose, fully restored. Her hair shimmered, her eyes glowed sharply, and an extraordinary aura surrounded her. She raised her hand, and the cosmic energy began healing all the wounded German soldiers around them. Injuries that had seemed impossible to heal closed up, and near-dead bodies regained normal functions.  <br><br>“Airy... you're back,” Alfie said, looking at her with a mix of awe and relief.  <br><br>Airy turned to him and smiled. “And it's all thanks to you, Alfie. You brought me back.”  <br><br>Without a second thought, Alfie embraced Airy tightly. “I thought I was going to lose you... again.”  <br><br>Airy returned his embrace. “I promise, I’ll never leave you. Now... let’s end this.”  <br><br>At the secret headquarters of the Thanamos Cult, their leaders, clad in black robes, stood around a large magical circle. <br><br>“That energy…” one of them spoke anxiously. “Airy has risen.”  <br><br>The cult leader, a masked man with a deep voice, nodded. “This is faster than we anticipated. Ei, Allen, and Firefly, pull back your forces. Do not confront Airy and Alfie now. They are not enemies we can defeat easily.”  <br><br>On the battlefield, Ei, Allen, and Firefly heard the order through their mental communication channel.  <br><br>“But we can finish them now!” protested Ei, who seemed to be fully under the cult's control. <br><br>“No, Ei,” the cult leader said firmly. “They are like creator gods. We must wait for the right moment.”  <br><br>Reluctantly, Ei, Allen, and Firefly retreated, leaving destruction in their wake.  <br><br>Airy and Alfie stood amidst the ruins of Berlin. They could feel their enemies pulling back.  <br><br>“Why are they retreating?” Alfie asked suspiciously.  <br><br>“They know it’s pointless to fight us now,” Airy replied in a calm yet cold tone. “But we won’t give them time to plan their next attack.”  <br><br>Airy raised her hand to the sky. Dark clouds began to gather, and blazing blue flames appeared in her hand. “Inferno,” she whispered.  <br><br>In an instant, an inferno of unimaginable heat shot into the air, creating waves of fire that incinerated everything in its path.  <br><br>“Death Storm,” Alfie shouted, raising both hands. Deadly winds surged from every direction, creating a whirlwind so powerful it destroyed the remaining buildings.  <br><br>Their combined powers wrought massive devastation. A raging inferno consumed the earth’s surface, while the storm shrouded the sun, plunging the world into eternal darkness.  <br><br>At the Thanamos Cult headquarters, their leaders were stunned by the unleashed power of Airy and Alfie. <br><br>“They’re going to destroy the world…” whispered one of the cult members. <br><br>After hours of relentless attacks, the destruction was complete. What were once great cities, mountains, and oceans were now flattened into barren lands. The only remnants were desolate plains and stagnant waters. <br><br>Airy and Alfie stood at the heart of the devastation. <br><br>“It’s done,” Alfie said, breathing heavily. <br><br>“But there are still survivors,” Airy said, her gaze fixed on a few people emerging from underground bunkers. They were members of the Thanamos Cult who had survived the assault. <br><br>Their attention was suddenly drawn to something extraordinary. In the distance, a colossal mountain stood tall. The mountain was so high that its peak pierced through the clouds, surpassing the tallest mountains in the world. <br><br>“That mountain… where did it come from?” Alfie asked in confusion.  <br><br>“It emerged from our cosmic energy,” Airy replied. “It’s a sign that the old world is over.” <br><br>The people who saw the mountain named it <strong>Airy Moon Mountain</strong> , a symbol of the end of World War III. <br><br>Although the world had been destroyed, Airy and Alfie knew their mission was far from over. Ei, Allen, and Firefly were still under the control of the Thanamos Cult.  <br><br>“We must bring them back,” Alfie said with a serious tone. <br><br>Airy nodded. “Yes. They’re our friends. And we won’t stop until they’re free.” <br><br>But deep in the shadows, the Thanamos Cult was planning something even more sinister, a threat greater than anything Airy and Alfie had ever faced before.</p>
