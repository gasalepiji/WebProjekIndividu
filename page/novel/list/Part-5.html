                    At the headquarters of the Thanamos Cult their mad experiments continued. They sought to perfect the liquid derived from the Pythacanomus bacteria a deadly microorganism capable of transforming humans into horrifying monsters or the undead if their bodies were too weak. <br><br>
                    A cult scientist shouted Experiment number 87 has failed The subject turned to ashes <br><br>
                    The cult leader glared coldly Enough experiments on weak human bodies Find stronger subjects <br><br>
                    A guard entered the room dragging several prisoners. One of them struggled fiercely Dont touch me Whatever your plans are I wont be your lab rat <br><br>
                    The leader laughed softly Oh you have no choice <br><br>
                    On the other side of the headquarters Ei was preparing. With cold eyes and a body full of old wounds she received direct orders from the cult leader <br><br>
                    You must find and destroy Airy and Alfie the leader commanded Use all your strength No mercy <br><br>
                    At the peak of Airy Moon Mountain Airy and Alfie were resting after forming an alliance with Karen and The Dark Knight. Although calm on the surface Airy felt that something was wrong. <br><br>
                    Alfie do you feel it Airy said softly <br><br>
                    Alfie opened his eyes A threat <br><br>
                    Airy nodded They sent something strong I must make sure we are safe <br><br>
                    In an instant Airy used her power to move Airy Moon Mountain close to Shadow City. In a flash the mountain appeared on the edge of the dark city startling the residents and the members of The Dark Knight. <br><br>
                    Iota the head of The Dark Knight’s espionage division saw the transfer through one of their monitoring tools. He rushed to the headquarters to meet with Alpha. <br><br>
                    Alpha he called The Airy Moon Mountain just appeared near Shadow City We must prepare <br><br>
                    Alpha furrowed his brows What do you mean Are they attacking us <br><br>
                    I’m not sure Iota replied But we should inform Karen <br><br>
                    Karen was immediately called and without wasting time she decided to confront Airy and Alfie directly. <br><br>
                    At the magnificent palace atop Airy Moon Mountain Airy and Alfie were relaxing when Karen arrived. <br><br>
                    Airy Alfie Karen called her voice calm but firm <br><br>
                    Alfie stood ready to face the worst-case scenario. However Airy stepped forward Karen what brings you here <br><br>
                    Karen stared at them I want to know why you moved this mountain near Shadow City Is this a threat <br><br>
                    Airy shook his head slightly No Karen I moved this mountain because I sensed a great threat from the Thanamos Cult I didn’t want to risk letting them find us while we’re weak <br><br>
                    Before Karen could respond a huge explosion shook the palace. <br><br>
                    The walls of the palace collapsed and Ei emerged from the smoke. With full force Ei attacked without warning destroying parts of the palace one by one. <br><br>
                    Ei shouted Alfie What are you doing <br><br>
                    But Ei did not respond. His black eyes showed that he was fully controlled by the Thanamos Cult. <br><br>
                    He found us even after I moved the mountain Airy said furrowing his brow. <br><br>
                    Karen who had never seen Ei before asked coldly Who is she <br><br>
                    He’s our friend Alfie replied But now he’s their weapon <br><br>
                    The battle began. Airy Alfie and Karen faced Ei who attacked with incredible strength. <br><br>
                    Alfie unleashed his nuclear power throwing a huge explosion toward Ei but Ei easily dodged it leaping and counterattacking with a rapid punch. <br><br>
                    Karen summoned darkness creating shadows that wrapped around Ei to hold him back. But Ei destroyed the shadows with a single strike showing his terrifying power. <br><br>
                    Airy tried to speak to him Ei listen to me You’re not our enemy <br><br>
                    But Ei did not respond. He kept attacking forcing the three of them to defend and counterattack. <br><br>
                    The battle went on for weeks. The terrain around Airy Moon Mountain changed completely due to the impact of their powers. Forests were destroyed rivers dried up and the sky was filled with dark clouds. <br><br>
                    In the midst of the battle Airy tried to use her power to return Ei to his original state. With her healing power she tried to break the Thanamos Cult’s control over their friend. <br><br>
                    After a month of relentless fighting Ei finally collapsed exhausted. Airy with her nearly depleted body managed to break the magic stone controlling Ei. <br><br>
                    Ei’s eyes returned to normal and he looked at Airy with an apologetic gaze. Airy Alfie I <br><br>
                    That’s enough Airy said embracing Ei You’re back now That’s what matters <br><br>
                    Alfie smiled slightly Welcome back Ei <br><br>
                    Karen who stood at a distance nodded slightly We have a lot to discuss <br><br>
                    After taking Ei to Shadow City for treatment he began telling what he knew about the Thanamos Cult. <br><br>
                    They want to conquer the world by harnessing cosmic power Ei said They used us Airy They were the ones who called me during the war against Fordial. They also have full control over three magic stones used to suppress our powers. <br><br>
                    And their leader Karen asked <br><br>
                    No one knows his identity Ei replied But he has full control over those stones. He is the greatest threat there ever was. <br><br>
                    After hearing the information from Ei Airy and Alfie returned to their palace to store this knowledge. <br><br>
                    This isn’t over Alfie said while looking out the window <br><br>
                    Airy nodded But now we know more We must prepare for their next move <br><br>
                    In Shadow City Karen took the lead of The Dark Knight once again to prepare for a counterattack. The Thanamos Cult had made their move but this new alliance was now stronger than ever. <br><br>
